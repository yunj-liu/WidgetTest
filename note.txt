Just as widgets can contain other widgets, layouts can be used to provide different levels of grouping for widgets. 
Here, we want to display a label alongside a line edit at the top of a window, 
above a table view showing the results of a query.

We achieve this by creating two layouts: queryLayout is a QHBoxLayout that contains QLabel and QLineEdit widgets placed side-by-side; 
mainLayout is a QVBoxLayout that contains queryLayout and a QTableView arranged vertically.
